data		| array  | An array of objects representing the current page of data in the result set.
pageNumber	| number | The current page in the full result set that the **data** array represents. Note: when a page number greater than **totalPages** is requested, the last page is instead returned.
pageSize	| number | The number of items in a page.  Omitted if there is no limit to page size (and hence, all results are included).  Unless otherwise specified, this defaults to **100** for most endpoints.
totalCount	| number | The total number of items in the full result set.
totalPages	| number | The total number of pages in the full result set.
